>"We provide complete files of geographic names information covering countries or geopolitical areas. The files are not in customary gazetteer format, but are in a special format amenable to input into geographic information systems, databases, and spreadsheets, giving end users powerful capabilities for data analysis, manipulation, and display. They are offered with both names formats provided within each of the files: Reading Order format (Mount Everest) that works well with mapping applications, and Reverse Generics format (Everest, Mount) that works well with gazetteer listings."
